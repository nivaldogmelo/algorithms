# algorithms

Just some algorithms implemented with Rust, made for study purposes

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Just some tests created with the intent of ensuring that the code is working with every valid input.

To execute you can run this command:

``` rust
cargo test
```

### Benchmark Tests

Those tests are created to measure algorithms efficiency with bigger inputs.

To execute you can run this command:

``` rust
cargo bench
```
